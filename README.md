# Light2DReplacementHelp
Example **Godot 3.1.1** project created to ask for help. I want to replace Light2D with sprite blending to achieve the same visual effect (as on Android Light2D has performance issues when there are 4 or more of them at the same time).

This is with Light2D (and what I want to achieve without Light2D):

This is with sprite blending:
